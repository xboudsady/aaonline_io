# Introduction

## Hello World

```ruby
puts "Hello World"  # => "Hello World"
puts "Goodbye"      # => "Goodbye"
```

## Comment
```ruby
puts "one"          # => "one"
#puts "tomato"   
puts "two"          # => "two"
puts "potato"       # => "potato"
```

# First Program
Write your first program! Using `puts`, print out a message. Make sure that your message is wrapped up in quotation marks. Run the code to see the output. 

Note: You'll notice that one of the lines in the code begins with a `#`. Adding `#` to the front of a line will create a comment. This line will not be executed as code, so they are useful to write notes to ourselves!

## Setup
```ruby
puts "Hello World!"

# Print out another message using puts below:
```
## Solution
```ruby
puts "Hello World!"

# Print out another message using puts below:
puts "Hello again!" # => "Hello again!"
```
